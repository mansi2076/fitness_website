            <h2>Muffin Mini Pizzas</h2>
            <h4>With Turkey Cheeseburger-Inspired Toppings</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>Indulge that inner child with a tasty lunch (or dinner) that’s big on flavor as well as nutrition. Using better-for-you ingredients makes these little indulgence all the more rewarding. Whole wheat English muffins act as our pizza base, or ‘dough’. An assortment of cheeseburger-inspired toppings are heaped onto our pizza base: lean ground turkey, low-fat shredded mozzarella cheese, sliced red onion, sliced tomatoes, chopped pickles, shredded lettuce, and a light drizzle of yellow mustard for a surprisingly burger-like finish. This is a great lunch option for those busy gotta-get-everything-done weekends. </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>The ground turkey can be cooked and chilled a day or two in advance, freeing up some time and leaving just the assembly and baking steps. If you’d like to take these mini pizzas to work, assemble them at home, bake them for 3-4 minutes (just to set the ingredients), and cool. Keep the onion, tomato, basil, pickles, and mustard separate, this will help keep your pizzas from getting soggy. When you’re ready for your lunch break, reheat the pizzas in a toaster oven and top with the toppings. </p>
