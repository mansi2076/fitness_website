            <h2>Homemade Sausage Breakfast Platter</h2>
            <h4>With a Sunny Side Up Egg</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>This recipe is partially inspired by the popular English-style breakfast, with just a little nutritional modification and simplifying for a quick and easy preparation, whether prepared during busy weekdays or weekends. Homemade turkey sausage patties — well-seasoned with sage, thyme, and paprika — are skillet-seared and served with a sunny side up egg. A pan-roasted tomato and toasted whole wheat bread round out this morning meal. If you’re still feeling hungry, feel free to serve this hearty meal with a side dish of fruit salad or a warm bowl of grain porridge.  </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>This turkey sausage recipe can easily be made a day or two in advance, either the raw, seasoned mixture or skillet cooked and cooled. You can also freeze the cooked sausage, thaw, and reheat when you’re ready to eat. </p>

            <h3>Preperation Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly grease a medium non-stick skillet with pan release spray and slowly heat over medium-high.</li>
                <li>Place ground turkey in a medium bowl and season with garlic powder, sage, thyme, paprika, and a small pinch of salt. Using your hands, mix to combine and divide into 2 patties.</li>
                <li>Once the skillet is hot, add the turkey sausage patties and cook for about 2 minutes per side, or until cooked through. Remove the sausage patties from the skillet, set aside on a serving plate, and lightly grease the skillet with additional cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Add the egg and halved tomato, cut side down, to the skillet; reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the egg is cooked to your liking and the tomato is tender.</li>
                <li>Lightly season both with salt and pepper and transfer to the plate with the sausage.</li>
                <li>Lastly, cut whole wheat toast into wedges and add to the plate before serving.</li>
