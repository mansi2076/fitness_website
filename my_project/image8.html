            <h2>Fruity Smoothie Bowl</h2>
            <h4>With Honey-Oat Dippers </h4>
          
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>This easy, simple, and fruit-forward smoothie bowl adds a little whimsy to your morning routine. The honey-oat dippers are made using whole wheat tortillas. The tortillas are first brushed with honey before being sprinkled with oats and cinnamon and baked until nicely golden and crisp. The smoothie bowl is a combination of tropical fruits, peaches, and bananas blended together with low-fat Greek yogurt for a tasty combination of nutritious ingredients. The fruits are also served on top of the smoothie bowl for a nice, filling texture difference. Spoon or dip 'til your heart's content. </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>The smoothie bowl mixture can be made well in advance (1-2 days) and refrigerated until ready to top and serve. The honey-oat dippers can also be made in advance, if thoroughly cooled and used within a day or two of baking.</p>
