            <h2>Baked Sweet Potato Fries</h2>
            <h4>Crisp and Satisfying Side Dish</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>These baked sweet potato fries are a satisfying side dish for any lunch or dinner. Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making them a much more wholesome substitute for traditional white potatoes. To get these baked fries crisp, we use a little cornstarch coating. The cornstarch forms a protective barrier around the potato, crisping the outside to a nice golden brown. Spreading the fries as far apart as possible on the baking sheet also enhances crispness, allowing for more airflow. If you’re cooking for a group — doubling or tripling this recipe — we recommend using a couple of baking sheets and rotating them halfway through the baking process.</p>

            <h3>Hacking this Recipe</h3>
            <p>You can prep the sweet potatoes well in advance and freeze the fresh-cut sweet potatoes until you’re ready to season and bake. Frozen sweet potato fries will need a little longer baking time, about 8-10 additional minutes. </p>
