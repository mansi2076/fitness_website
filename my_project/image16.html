            <h2>Healthy Homemade Banana Ice Cream Recipe:</h2>
            <h4>Banana Shake Dessert</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>Who says that dessert has to be unhealthy? I argue that some of the most delicious, guilty tasting foods out there are also some of the healthiest. This homemade banana ice cream recipe is one of those examples where something that tastes like a dessert is actually really very good for you.

                This easy ice cream recipe is free of any unnecessary sugars or unhealthy additives. Thanks to the banana it also serves up a good dose of fiber, manganese, potassium, and vitamin B-6, which is great for cell growth, muscle reconstruction and tissue repair.

            <h3>One or more of the following healthy toppings</h3>
            <li>Any kind of diced nuts; walnuts or almonds are best – Nuts add protein, fiber and a variety of vitamins, depending on which type you choose.</li>
            <li>A couple of small pieces of dark chocolate – Dark chocolate has antioxidants which have been shown to help fight off cancer; the higher the cacao content the better.</li>
            <li> Fresh fruit – All of the fruits offer a wealth of health benefits; you can’t make a bad choice here.</li>
            <li>A scoop of peanut butter – High in Manganese, Niacin, and protein, good ole PB also offers healthy fats that will help fight off hunger.</li>
            <li>Cinnamon – Almost completely free of calories and fats, this spice offers Iron, Vitamin K and even a small metabolism boost.</li>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A Blender</li>
                <li>Bananas (roughly one for each bowl of “ice cream”)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preperation Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To make this simple shake you will need to freeze the bananas first. Most store-bought blenders are not that hefty, so it’s a good idea to cut your fruit into small cubed sections so that it can blend well. Put your banana sections into a Ziploc bag and let them freeze completely (they are usually good to go after about 4-5 hours).</li>
                <li>Add your frozen banana sections to the blender and blend away. If it seems to be having trouble blending, you can add a little bit of milk to the mixture in order to help it along a bit.</li>
                <li>You can change the consistency of your treat by adding more milk or continuing to blend until it is smoother or thinner. You can also sweeten this recipe by adding vanilla extract or honey.</li>
                <li>Your banana ice cream is going to be best eaten directly after you’ve made it. Add your concoction to a little bowl and sprinkle a serving of one or more of the above-suggested toppings and enjoy your healthy treat.</li>
