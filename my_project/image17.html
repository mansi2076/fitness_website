Cover with a layer of cottage cheese, and assorted veggies, topping it with mozzarella, and parmesan cheese. Cover with another layer of noodles and build another layer. Finish top layer with remaining sauce and mozzarella and parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Cover the Vegetarian Lasagna with aluminum foil and place in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes; then take off the foil and cook for another 10-20 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
