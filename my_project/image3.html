            <h2>Stuffed Pepper Soup</h2>
            <h4>With Ground Turkey and Bell Peppers</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>Just like the classic stuffed peppers dish, this soup is made using easy-to-source ingredients like ground turkey, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, tomatoes, and rice. Red bell peppers bring a level of natural sweetness while green bell peppers add verdant, earthy pops. Ground turkey replaces the traditional ground beef for a leaner protein option. Brown rice is a fabulous whole grain. Being a whole grain means that brown rice contains all parts of the grain: the fibrous bran, the protein-rich germ, and the hearty-carb endosperm. White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed. Since these are the most nutritious parts of the grain, brown rice is our go-to for maximum nutrition. </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>We also use pre-cooked brown rice in this recipe. We’re notorious for making or cooking batches of basic pantry staples that will be frequently used throughout the week — quinoa, brown rice, etc. This really cuts down on the overall cooking time as well as day-of prep. For our fans of prepping ahead, this soup is a fabulous option. Cook, chill, refrigerate, and reheat when ready to enjoy.</p>
