                <li>5 lbs Tomatoes</li>
                <li>1/4 Cup Olive oil</li>
                <li>6 Garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1½ tsp Salt</li>

            <h3>Preperation Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the tomatoes thoroughly with cool water. Slice them depending on their size; the small grape sized ones are okay to leave whole, but chop the medium sized ones in half and the extra large ones into quarters.
                </li>
                <li>Place the cleaned and diced tomatoes into a saucepan that is oven and stovetop friendly. Place the garlic cloves in with the tomatoes, along with the salt and pepper, then drizzle the olive oil over the top. Mix and place in the preheated oven at 400° for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once they are done in the oven, place the same saucepan on the stovetop on low heat. Use a handheld blender to thoroughly blend the mixture.
                </li>
