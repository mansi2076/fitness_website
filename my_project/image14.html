            <h2>Rustic Red Rice</h2>
            <h4>With Onion, Peppers, and Tomatoes</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>This rustic red rice recipe pulls inspiration from the famed Arroz Rojo, a Mexican-style rice cooked with fragrant and flavorful ingredients: garlic, onion, peppers, and tomatoes. To boost our overall nutritional value, we opted for brown rice, adding a little more protein and fiber to this side dish. Brown rice is a fabulous whole grain. Being “whole” means that brown rice contains all parts of the grain: the fibrous bran, the protein-rich germ, and the hearty-carb endosperm. White rice, on the other hand, has had the bran and germ removed. Try this fantastic side dish with either meat or veggie main dishes. It’s a perfect accompaniment to tacos, burritos, or Mexican cuisine-inspired recipes too! </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>The whole grain nature of brown rice means that it takes a little while longer to cook than most other rice options. To save on time, cook this side dish ahead of time, then cool, refrigerate, and reheat (either on the stovetop with a little extra broth or in the microwave) before serving.</p>
