            <h2> Veggie Pasta</h2>
            <h4>15 Minute Recipe</h4>

            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>It is such a common food and probably its comforting feel and ease of preparation are what makes it so appealing to all of us. Pasta is traditionally made of eggs and wheat flour which in its original form provides a balanced source of complex carbohydrates, protein and fat. Due to the period of industrialization, manufacturers started to make a product stripped of all nutrients and high in refined carbs. This made pasta gain a notoriety for being unhealthy and bad for your overall health.</p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>If you tend to have stubborn digestion or a sensitive stomach, or are brand new to eating high fiber dishes, you can always bake or saut√©e the veggies in olive or avocado oil before adding to the salad, in order to make them easier on your belly. Feel free to get creative with whatever veggies you have in the kitchen. You can also choose pasta of your own choice. Stick to gluten free variety if you are gluten intolerant or are looking to avoid gluten. Buckwheat, chickpea and amaranth are great options.</p>
