            <h2>Cottage Cheese and Whole Wheat Flour Pancakes</h2>
            <h4>Topped with Tropical Fruit and Honey</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>These fluffy pancakes are made with a combination of whole wheat flour and low-fat cottage cheese for a quick, easy, and flavorful breakfast option. A simple topping of tropical fruit and honey adds oodles of flavor without impacting your busy morning routine or your grocery shopping budget. Cottage cheese might sound like an unusual ingredient for pancakes but, you must trust us, the resulting flapjacks are moist and fluffy. They also refrigerate, freeze, and reheat really well for those that enjoy prepping ahead for an even faster morning meal. </p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>The pancake batter can be made well in advance and refrigerated until ready to cook and serve. The pancakes themselves could be cooked, cooled, refrigerated, and reheated (we like toasting our pre-made pancakes in a toaster oven or conventional oven). Freeze pancakes by layering them in between sheets of wax paper and wrapping them tightly in plastic, or placing them in a sealable container. These pancakes can be kept frozen for 1-2 months.
