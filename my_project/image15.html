            <h2>Breakfast Fried Rice</h2>
            <h4>With Eggs and Veggies</h4>
            <br>
            <h3>The Dish</h3>
            <p>This fried rice recipe is chock full of vegetables. Onions, broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers, and brown rice make up the bulk of the ingredients, adding to this robust, filling, and satisfyingly yummy dish. The sunny side up eggs add a mighty protein boost and cook quickly. This recipe is ideal for a quick weekday breakfast. To season our breakfast fried rice, we use a combination of low sodium soy sauce, sugar free ketchup, and honey. This simple sauce effectively infuses the entire dish with flavor — we love it!</p>

            <h3>Time Saving Tips</h3>
            <p>For the best fried rice results, cook and chill the brown rice a day or two before making this recipe (precooked and chilled rice stir fries crispy, while freshly-cooked rice still retains a lot of moisture and will get clumpy when stir frying). Cooking the rice ahead of time not only makes for great-tasting fried rice, but also cuts down on the prep time you’ll need the day of the meal. </p>

            <h3>Preperation Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and lightly grease with pan release spray.</li>
                <li>Once the pan is hot, add onion, zucchini, red bell pepper, and broccoli. Saute for 4-5 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender-crisp.</li>
                <li>Push the veggies to the outermost sides of the pan, making a large well in the center. Add cooked rice to the skillet, and spread out in an even layer.</li>
                <li>Cook the rice for 2 minutes, not stirring, until slightly crispy and golden brown in places.</li>
                <li>Place ketchup, soy sauce, and honey in a small bowl and whisk to combine. Add the sauce to the skillet and stir to combine, mixing the rice and the veggies together.</li>
                <li>Continue to saute, stirring occasionally, for another 2 minutes. Remove the fried rice from the skillet and set aside on a plate. Wipe the skillet clean with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel and return to the heat (lightly grease with additional pan release spray if necessary).</li>
                <li>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the whites are no longer runny (you can cook your eggs for longer, if desired). Season the eggs to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place the eggs on the plate with the fried rice, garnish with chopped scallions, and serve immediately.</li>
